h1. UhOh! Changelog

h2. v1.3

* Patched show_error so that it now detects if the error was thrown by an extension (i.e. MY_Loader), if so treat it as a system file.

h2. v1.2

* The show_error now outputs a stack trace as well as shows you the original line that caused the error (i.e. the line that loads the view in your app).

h2. v1.1

* Better handling for getting absolute paths for the system and application directories.
* Now logs error messages to the CodeIgniter log when enabled.
* Added a nicer looking General Error template.
* Extended show_error() so that it won't send headers if it has already been sent.

h2. v1.0
